The patient reports that he was at the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic changes. Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient was transferred for further care. In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and metoprolol tartrate 50mg.
