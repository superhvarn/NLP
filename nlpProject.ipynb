Denies pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like other episodes when she then required her stent placement.

It is unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in the ED. The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 milligram/kilogram/min. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes. TECHNIQUE: ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; (___) 29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM admin) Dipyridamole; IMAGING METHOD: Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images. Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model. FINDINGS: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast attenuation. Left ventricular cavity size is increased. Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an EDV of 117 ml. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic function. Compared with prior study of ___, the cavity size is larger. <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 2.
